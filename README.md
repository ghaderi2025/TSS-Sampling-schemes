hello. welcome.
There are three general codes for all schemes.
In fact, we have two schemes in each code. The first code, denoted by "Using RSS in two successive samplings", refers to schemes A_1 and A_2.
The second one denoted by "without an auxiliary variable", schemes A_3 and A_4 refers to A_3 and A_4 schemes respectively and 
finally, the code denoted by "with an auxiliary variable", scheme A_5 and A_6 refers to A_5 and A_6 schemes respectively.
